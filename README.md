Classic tile-matching memory game using C++ and Qt

A project just to test the Qt framework.
12 tiles are displayed, as well as a countdown starting at 1:00. User needs to click on two tiles and try to match the images they show. If there's a match, score increases, if no match score descreases.
Whenever 2 tiles are matched, they remain uncovered. If no match, tiles are turned back after a second. User wins when all tiles have been matched or loses if the time is up before all matches could be made.
After the game is over, the user can choose to play again or quit the game.
No levels or anything, just a simple game.
